Recommendations:
An API is a user interface for a developer - so put some effort into making it pleasant
Use RESTful URLs and actions
Use SSL everywhere, no exceptions
An API is only as good as its documentation - so have great documentation
Version via the URL, not via headers (no version id in the url means, the latest version)
Use query parameters for advanced filtering, sorting & searching
Provide a way to limit which fields are returned from the API
Return something useful from POST, PATCH & PUT requests
HATEOAS isn't practical just yet
Use JSON where possible, XML only if you have to
You should use camelCase with JSON, but snake_case is 20% easier to read
Pretty print by default & ensure gzip is supported
Don't use response envelopes by default
Consider using JSON for POST, PUT and PATCH request bodies
Paginate using Link headers
Provide a way to autoload related resource representations
Provide a way to override the HTTP method
Provide useful response headers for rate limiting
Use token based authentication, transported over OAuth2 where delegation is needed
Include response headers that facilitate caching
Define a consumable error payload
Effectively use HTTP Status codes

* The key principles of REST involve separating your API into logical resources.
These resources are manipulated using HTTP requests where the method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) has specific meaning.
* Blank fields are included as null instead of being omitted.
* All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format:  YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
* if the relation is commonly requested alongside the resource, the API could offer functionality to
automatically embed the relation's representation and avoid the second hit to the API. (note: for the relation
between exercise and workout)
* To prevent an API consumer from having to hit the API again for an updated representation, have the API return the updated (or created) representation as part of the response.
* Pagination: put total size in the header (X-Total-Count)
* Creating resource: The response is generally 201 Created with a Location header indicating where the new resource was created, and the created resource in the response body.

* Error message:
{
    "status": 404,
    "code": 40483,
    "message": "Oops! It looks like that file does not exist.",
    "developerMessage": "File resource for path /uploads/foobar.txt does not exist.  Please wait 10 minutes until the upload batch completes before checking again.",
    "timestamp": 2015-12-03T00:11:05.211
}

Question:
Should I create a separate object for the responses, or should I send the internal object (like we do it
in carrier-integration)
A: so it might be appropriate to define three internal representations which map to a single Bookmark resource externally:
   class NewBookmark represents a bookmark being created
   class Bookmark represents a full, created, bookmark
   class BookmarkUpdates represents updates to a bookmark
Use DTOs
